    HOUSEKEEPING: Define named constants
    	CUBIC_INCHES_PER_CUBIC_FOOT = 1728
    INPUT: Collect information from the user
    	PRINT "Enter the refrigerator model name:"
    	READ refrigeratorModelName
    	PRINT "Enter the interior height of the refrigerator (in inches): "
    	READ interiorHeight
    	PRINT "Enter the interior width of the refrigerator (in inches): "
    	READ interiorWidth
    	PRINT "Enter the interior depth of the refrigerator (in inches): "
    	READ interiorDepth
    PROCESS: Calculate the capacity in cubic feet
    	cubicInches = interiorHeight * interiorWidth * interiorDepth
    	refrigeratorCapacityCubicFeet = cubicInches / CUBIC_INCHES_PER_CUBIC_FOOT
    OUTPUT: Display the refrigerator model name and its capacity
    	PRINT "Refrigerator model is: ", refrigeratorModelName
    	PRINT "Refrigerator capacity is: ", refrigeratorCapacityCubicFeet, " cubic feet"
